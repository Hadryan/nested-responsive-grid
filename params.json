{"name":"Nested Responsive Grid","body":"### Bootstrap&rsquo;s Nested Responsive Grid\r\nWhen using another grid framework (like Twitter Bootstrap), nested grids get weird:\r\n\r\n>Nesting with fluid grids is a bit different: the number of nested columns doesn't need to match the parent. Instead, your columns are reset at each level because each row takes up 100% of the parent column.\r\n\r\n<pre>&lt;div class=\"row-fluid\">\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"span6\">\r\n\t\t6\r\n\t\t&lt;div class=\"row-fluid\">\r\n\t\t\t&lt;div class=\"span6\">3&lt;/div>\r\n\t\t\t&lt;div class=\"span6\">3&lt;/div>\r\n\t\t&lt;/div>\r\n\t&lt;/div>\r\n&lt;/div></pre>\r\n\r\nThat means that the sub columns will each be a &ldquo;3&rdquo; column. But, that 3 column width will not be the same as a standalone 3 column since it is a percentage of another percentage. It&rsquo;s kind of hard to explain, but the below image should illustrate the problem.\r\n\r\n![Bootstrap Nested Responsive Grid Demo](https://github.com/davist11/nested-responsive-grid/raw/master/images/nested-bootstrap.png)\r\n\r\n### My Nested Responsive Grid\r\nI hated that. So in my system, a &ldquo;3&rdquo; sub-column would equal the width of a standalone 3 column\r\n\r\n<pre>&lt;div class=\"row\">\r\n\t&lt;div class=\"span6\">\r\n\t\t6\r\n\t\t&lt;div class=\"row\">\r\n\t\t\t&lt;div class=\"span3\">3&lt;/div>\r\n\t\t\t&lt;div class=\"span3\">3&lt;/div>\r\n\t\t&lt;/div>\r\n\t&lt;/div>\r\n&lt;/div></pre>\r\n\r\n![Nested Responsive Grid Demo](https://github.com/davist11/nested-responsive-grid/raw/master/images/nested.png)","tagline":"Generate a responsive grid that maintains itâ€™s column sizes two levels deep.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
